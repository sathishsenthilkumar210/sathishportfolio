      <h3>Abstract:</h3>
      <p>
        Head injuries caused by a bullet penetration or shock waves from the
        improvised explosive device (IED) are the main causes of military
        traumatic brain injury or death. Improvements in ballistic and impact
        protection of helmets may help to increase the survival rate of the
        soldiers. A ballistic helmet is designed to protect the wearer from
        impact by absorbing and dissipating energy without transmitting it to
        the head. Combat or ballistic helmets made from conventional Kevlar
        material has some drawbacks such as limited strength, thermal
        discomfort, durability issues and poor moisture resistance. In this
        proposed work. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber
        will be used as a helmet material which is 15 times stronger than the
        steel and 2 times stronger than the Kevlar. Moreover, in the
        conventional ballistic helmet three to four holes are provided to fit
        the accessories. Holes increases the stress concentration which
        ultimately weakens the strength of the helmet. In this work, the holes
        will be avoided in the load direction. Finally, a combat helmet will be
        fabricated based on the simulation results.
      </p>
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        For over three decades, state-of-the-art ballistic helmets depended
        entirely on aramid fibers. Currently work continues on the production of
        ballistic composites based on polyethylene fibers of ultra-high
        molecular weight (UHMWPE), polypropylene (PP) and carbon fibers. The
        material properties for a ballistic helmet are standard, depending upon
        the helmet type. The properties of selected materials used for helmets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene fiber was a very promising
        material for making light-weight high strength and high impact resistant
        composites, especially for ballistic head protection. Project shows that
        forming helmets of commercial high strength polyethylene fiber prepreg
        is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial Dyneema® HB25 materials were used in the study. The Enhanced
        Combat Helmet (ECH), which has been under development since 2007 for the
        US Marine Corps and US Army, makes use of Dyneema® HB80 unidirectional
        composite material, which consists of a matrix of ultra-high molecular
        weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) reinforced by carbon fibers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weathering and gamma radiation effects on the ballistic properties
        of UHMWPE composite armour were studied by Alves et al. Composite plates
        were subjected to weathering (2 and 4 months) and gamma irradiation (25
        kGy and 250 kGy).
      </p>
      <p>
        It was found that exposure to weathering for 4 months did not cause
        significant changes in ballistic impact resistance. However, it
        significantly increased delamination failures in the plate under a
        projectile impact, which was attributed to oxygen diffusion between the
        layers, reducing the interfacial resistance. Also it was observed that
        exposure to gamma radiation reduced the ballistic resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The higher the gamma radiation dosage, the larger the local damaged
        area. It was concluded that exposure to weathering and gamma radiation
        induces modification in the UHMWPE molecular structure, leading to
        changes in the mechanical and ballistic properties of the composite. It
        is therefore necessary to test the UHMWPE based helmet periodically to
        ensure that weathering and gamma radiation do not compromise the
        ballistic impact resistance of the helmet.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has become known that UHMWPE/ carbon fiber composites can provide
        higher ballistic protection at a reduced weight than the composites used
        in current helmets. Polymer matrix nano-composites, especially those
        reinforced by carbon nanotubes, can potentially offer the highest
        ballistic protection. However, their viability in terms of manufacturing
        feasibility and cost effectiveness needs to be further explored.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ballistic performance of helmets depends on the composite material
        properties, the type of fibers and matrix, the fiber orientation, the
        interaction between the fibers and matrix, as well as on the parameters
        of processing the composites dedicated for the helmet shell.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the literature a process was disclosed for producing a hybrid helmet
        consisting in forming an outer layer of carbon fiber and polyethylene
        material as well as the application of polyester resin used to glue the
        outer layers to the inner layers of aramid. Patent specification shows a
        protective helmet which is made from 17 layers of aramid fabric and 13
        layers of polyethylene impregnated with a resin based on vinyl ester.
      </p>
      <p>
        The composition was pressed at a pressure of 190 tons and temperature of
        121 °C for 15 minutes. In turn, U.S. Patent presents a hybrid helmet
        constructed of composite materials which includes layers of aramid
        fabric and polyethylene. The fibrous materials used to produce the
        hybrid ballistic helmet were reinforced with a matrix of resins:
        phenolic, acrylic and polyester.
      </p>
      <p>
        A promising area of research aims to provide soldiers with better
        protection and comfort during combat operations by creating a
        lightweight ballistic helmet with improved comfort for frontline
        soldiers using UHMWPE (Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene).
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to its exceptional mechanical properties, UHMWPE, a high-strength,
        lightweight material, has been used in many applications, including body
        armour. It is the perfect material for creating a lightweight, highly
        protective ballistic helmet due to its low density and high strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        UHMWPE has excellent mechanical qualities, but it also has the potential
        to make the helmet more comfortable by lightening the load and allowing
        for more ventilation. This can lessen problems like fatigue, heat
        stress, and discomfort, which can significantly affect how well
        frontline soldiers perform and are effective in combat operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        UHMWPE can be used to create a lightweight ballistic helmet that is both
        highly protective and cosy to wear for extended periods on frontline
        soldiers. This can increase their capacity for duty performance, lower
        their risk of injury, and improve their general comfort and well-being
        throughout combat operations.
