      <h3>Abstract:</h3>
      <p>
        Agriculture is one of the oldest professions but the development and use
        of machinery has made the job title of farmer a rarity. Instead of every
        person having to work to provide food for themselves, smaller portion of
        our population today works in agriculture, the smaller portion provides
        considerably more food than the other can eat. The basic technology of
        agricultural machines has changed little in the last century with the
        coming of the Industrial Revolution and the development of more
        complicated machines. In this work design and fabricate the automatic
        mechanical cutter by using crank and slotted lever mechanism, for
        cutting agricultural products like sugarcane for cultivation. The
        present work to fabricate a machine which is simple in construction than
        the existing machines. The equipment make the use of crank and slotted
        lever mechanism with one slider to couple with an electric motor using
        pulley and belt drive.
      </p>
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The working principle behind the operation of simple mechanical cutting
        machine is four bar chain mechanism particularly crank and slotted lever
        mechanism. The crank wheel is rotated by the motor through the pulley
        belt assembly. The rotating motion the crank wheel is converted into
        oscillating motion by the coupling link by using the slider. The
        oscillating motion at the other end of the coupling link is converted
        into reciprocating motion to the blade by using guide hole. Therefore
        the rotating motion of the crank wheel is converted into reciprocating
        motion to the blade through the coupling link.

        Agriculture is the only means of living for almost two thirds of the
        workers in India. The agriculture sector of India has occupied 43% of
        India’s geographical area, and is contributing 16.1% of India’s GDP.
        Agriculture still contributes significantly to India’s GDP despite
        decline of its share in India’s GDP. There are number of crops grown by
        farmers. These include different food crops, commercial crops, oil seeds
        etc. Sugarcane is one of the important commercial crops grown in India.
      </p>
      <p>
        In India agriculture is facing serious challenges like scarcity of
        agricultural labor, not only in peak working seasons but also in normal
        time. This is mainly for increased nonfarm job opportunities having
        higher wage, migration of labor force to cities and low status of
        agricultural labors in the society Approximately 80% of the world’s
        sugar is produced from sugarcane in tropical and subtropical climates,
        with the remaining 20% derived from sugar beet, which is grown mostly in
        the temperate zones of the northern hemisphere. 70 countries produce
        sugar from sugarcane, 40 from sugar beet and 10 from both. In
        agricultural harvesting we require maximum man power, ample money and
        also it is more time consuming process. In cutting process we face
        various problems and these are not easily solved. The design of this
        machine is very simple also easy to implement. In this manner we are
        designing the Sugarcane Cutting Machine to reduce effort and time. In
        sugar cane farms we are using this machine for cutting purpose. This is
        user friendly cutting machine; anyone can handle this machine in any
        working condition. Skilled persons aren’t required for operating this
        machine.
